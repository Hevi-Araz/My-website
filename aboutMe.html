<h1>About me</h1>
<hr />
<body>
<p>Hello there!<br /> I'm Hevi Araz, a 20-year-old residing in Sulaymani. Currently, 
    I'm immersed in the world of computer science as a student,<br /> 
    delving into the fascinating realm of programming. My journey started with grasping the 
    fundamentals of the Java programming language during my college years.</p>

    <p> While I'm navigating
     the exciting challenges of academia, my heart finds joy in two particular realms of 
     entertainment-anime TV shows and the enchanting world of books. I believe in the power 
     of storytelling to transport us to different dimensions and expand our horizons.
    </p>
    <p> Although my 
        professional journey is just beginning, I'm eager to explore the vast possibilities that 
        lie ahead in the world of technology. Join me on this adventure,
         where curiosity knows no bounds!
   </p>
